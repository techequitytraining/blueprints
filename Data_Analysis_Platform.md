# Data Analysis Platform

## Overview

This blueprint presents a comprehensive guide for creating a managed environment for research and data analytics purposes. It showcases the use of publicly available datasets, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), to facilitate data exploration and analysis through Jupyter Notebooks within a cloud-based workbench environment. This framework is intended to be flexible, allowing for customization and expansion to meet the diverse needs of research and analytics projects.

## Cloud Services Utilized

- **Workbench Notebooks:** For interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Virtual Private Cloud:** Ensures secure and efficient network management of cloud resources.
- **Data Warehouse Service:** Provides scalable solutions for large-scale data analytics.
- **Data Sharing and Analytics Platform:** Facilitates access to and analysis of shared data resources.
- **Cloud Storage:** Offers reliable and scalable storage solutions for data.
- **Budget Management:** Tools to monitor and control cloud spending, ensuring cost-effectiveness.

## Reference Architecture
