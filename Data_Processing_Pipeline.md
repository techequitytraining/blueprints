# Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview

This blueprint offers a scalable and automated framework for executing data processing tasks in a serverless environment. It is designed to facilitate seamless data processing workflows, from quality control checks to complex data analysis, without the need for dedicated server infrastructure. Leveraging containerized tools and the Google Cloud API, this setup provides a flexible and efficient approach to managing data processing jobs.

## Cloud Services Utilized

- **Cloud Functions:** For event-driven execution of data processing tasks.
- **Cloud Storage:** To store input data files and output results securely.
- **Virtual Private Cloud:** For secure network management of cloud resources.
- **Life Sciences API:** To automate the execution of containerized data processing jobs.
- **Compute Engine:** For scalable compute resources to run data processing tasks.
- **Container Registry:** To manage and store containerized tools and applications.
- **Billing Budget:** For monitoring and managing cloud spending.

## Reference Architecture

The architecture diagram below illustrates the components and flow of the Serverless Data Processing Framework. It depicts how data files uploaded to a designated Cloud Storage bucket trigger automated data processing jobs, utilizing containerized tools and the Life Sciences API for execution.

## Getting Started

- **Containerized Tools:** The framework uses containerized tools, such as a Quality Control Tool, to perform data processing tasks. These tools are stored in the Container Registry and can be customized to fit specific processing needs.
- **Automated Workflow:** Uploading data files to the input Cloud Storage bucket automatically initiates the processing pipeline. Processed data and logs are then stored in the output bucket, enabling a streamlined and automated workflow.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** The serverless nature of the framework allows for scalability and flexibility, adapting to varying workloads without the need for manual infrastructure management.

## Use Cases

This framework is suitable for a wide range of data processing applications, from simple quality control checks to more complex data analysis pipelines. It is particularly beneficial for scenarios requiring high scalability, automated workflows, and minimal infrastructure management.

## Customization and Adaptation

While the reference implementation demonstrates a Quality Control Tool, the framework can be easily adapted to utilize other data processing tools and workflows. This flexibility ensures that the Serverless Data Processing Framework can meet diverse data processing requirements across different domains.
