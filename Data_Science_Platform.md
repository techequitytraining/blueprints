# Data Science Platform

## Overview

This module outlines the setup for a comprehensive Data Science Platform, designed to facilitate advanced data analysis and machine learning projects. Leveraging cloud-based services, the platform provides a robust environment for data scientists to develop, test, and deploy their Jupyter Notebooks and data models.

## Cloud Services Utilized

- **Vertex AI Workbench Notebooks:** For interactive data analysis and machine learning model development.
- **BigQuery:** A fully-managed data warehouse for large-scale analytics.
- **Cloud Storage:** Object storage for storing any amount of data and retrieving it at any time.
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** A private network for managing the cloud resources securely.
- **Billing Budget:** To monitor cloud spending and stay within budget.
